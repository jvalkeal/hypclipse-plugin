Project wizard will steer you through the process by asking various questions and giving user 
a possibility to use different templates to add custom content to project.

<p>

It&#39;s also possible to add project to eclipse working sets, if user is using that feature.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Project name – Unique name of the eclipse project.</li>
  <li>Location – Where this project is located.</li>
  <li>Source folder – Java source folder within project.</li>
  <li>Output folder – Folder within project where eclipse is compiling java classes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Content page is asking user to fill information related to HQ.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Plug-in Name – This is a base plug-in name which will be used in descriptor file and in named jar file after export operation.</li>
  <li>Plug-in Package – Base package name where all custom classes are created during project creation. This parameter is also used in root level plug-in tag as package attribute.</li>
  <li>Execution Environment – Wizard allows to select which java environment used during development.</li>
  <li>HQ Environment – Base HQ agent bundle which will be used to compile classes.</li>
  <li>Product Plug-in – If user wants to create simple example of product plug-in class, name of the class can be given.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When new HQ plug-in project is created using project wizard, certain templates can be used to 
automatically add extra content to newly created HQ plug-in. Template contains instructions 
how to update internal models which describes HQ descriptor structures. If template is used 
to create custom java classes, also those are included in the template structure.
</p>
<p>
When basic project and HQ information is asked from user, possibility to allow wizard to 
automatically extend plug-in features is given to user. User may select one 
template(e.q. one auto discovered server process) for one specific need to create 
custom HQ plug-in. Also it&#39;s possible to select multiple templates. Not all templates may not 
be suitable to use together. In this case template list may be a little different.
