<h1>Install HQ Agent Bundles</h1>

<p>
Developing custom plug-ins usually means that there is references to existing packages 
available from agent bundles. Hypclipse needs to know where these agent bundle are located on 
the machine where hypclise is used.
</p>

<p>
Go to hyperic web site <a href="http://www.hyperic.com">www.hyperic.com</a> and download installation package. There is no need to run 
HQ agent, so only extraction of the agent package is needed. Hypclipse preferences page contain 
list of stored agent environments, which are later used when creating new HQ Plug-in Projects.
